# Contribution Guidelines

This project is open to Hacktoberfest 2022.

I will only consider pull requests pertaining to open issues or TODO comments. 
You need to have an integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA 
or Apache NetBeans, with JUnit.

A pull request should not cause any existing tests to fail, but it may contain 
intermediate commits with failing tests.

Do not delete any tests, unless you can absolutely demonstrate they're 
unnecessary (redundancy is not proof of being unnecessary, especially where 
inheritance and polymorphism are involved).

At first, I was using JUnit 4, I believe I have switched over the project to 
JUnit 5, but I'll have to check.

Use Maven for the build tool. Even though Maven is awful, it seems to be absolutely required for Java Hacktoberfest projects.

# Contribution Guidelines

I intend to open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021.

I will only consider pull requests pertaining to open issues or TODO comments. 
You need to have an integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA 
or Apache NetBeans, with JUnit.

Currently this project uses JUnit 4, but I plan to switch it over to JUnit 5 
before October.
